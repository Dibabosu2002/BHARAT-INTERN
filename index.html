            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>👋 Hello! I'm currently a fourth-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate in Btech at University Of Engineering And Management (2020 - 2024), Kolkata. I'm on a journey to transform my passion for technology and innovation into a fulfilling CAREER. 🚀

📚 Over the years, I've invested my time and energy in expanding my skill set. I hold certifications in IoT, UI/UX Design, Core Java, and AWS, all obtained through rigorous courses on Coursera. My curiosity led me to explore the world of UI/UX design further during an enriching internship experience, where I had the chance to work with Figma.

🎮 When I'm not immersed in coding or pursuing my studies, I find solace in the virtual realms of video games. They provide a creative outlet and a unique way to unwind. Besides gaming, I have a deep appreciation for the horror genre in cinema, and I'm always open to discussing spine-tingling film recommendations.

🛠️ My technical aspirations are centered around crafting lightning-fast, dynamic webpages using the trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This journey has been enriched by my active participation in my college's project and poster competitions, where I was part of a team that developed innovative image editing software.

🎲 Speaking of software development, I've also dabbled in game design, creating a delightful Connect 4 game and several others like Stack towers and the Snake Game using Java during my 2nd and 3rd years.

💪 I firmly believe that success is a product of hard work, good intentions, and smart strategies. I'm a quick learner and a strong and humble advocate for absorbing knowledge from diverse sources.

🤝 I'm always excited to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share with me, a common passion for technology and hunger for new innovations. Let's work together to make a meaningful impact on the tech world! 🌐

🌲OPEN TO WORK AND GRASP OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD SHAPE ME EVEN BETTER IN THE FUTURE 🔮.</p>
